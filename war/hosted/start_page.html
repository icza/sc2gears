<h2 class=sc2gears>October 7, 2015 - Patch 3.0 - The END of Sc2gears</h2>
StarCraft II's Patch 3.0 rendered Sc2gears' parsing engine incapable of doing its work. In short: Sc2gears can no longer parse replays since Patch 3.0.<br/>
<br/>
No further updates will be released for Sc2gears, only <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/">Scelight</a> will be maintained. Visit the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/">Scelight home page</a> and start using it.<br/>

<b>&#10014; R.I.P. Sc2gears! Lived 5 years, 6 months and 5 days! (April 2, 2010 - October 7, 2015)</b><br/>
<br/>
May God bless You All.<br/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">July 15, 2015 - The Sc2gears Database is shutting down</h2>
The Sc2gears Database is shutting down. As of now, no new accounts can be created.<br/>
<br/>
On <b>July 28th, 2015</b> starting at 12pm Pacific Time, the Sc2gears Database will be temporarily shut down for 24 hours.<br/>
On <b>August 4th, 2015</b> the Sc2gears Database will be permanently shut down at 12:00pm Pacific time.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for shutting down the Sc2gears Database is because it is built using a service of the Google App Engine Platform that will be shut down at the mentioned times.<br/>
<br/>
There will be no more Sc2gears releases. Currently Sc2gears supports only WoL and HotS, and it doesn't support LotV. And this will remain this way.<br/>
Most likely when LotV is released, Sc2gears will stop functioning for all replays (including WoL, HotS and LotV) due to replay format changes.<br/>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">March 9 - Sc2gears Database Free Package Quota Decreased</h2>
The Quota of the Free Sc2gears Database package has been decreased from 50 MB to <span style='text-decoration:line-through;color:#666666'>10</span> <b>5 MB</b>.<br/>
Replays and files that you have already uploaded and are over the quota are not deleted yet. You have 3 weeks to review your package.<br/>
<br/>
Starting on April 1, 2014, files may be deleted of accounts with the Free package that are over the 100% of their quota.<br/>
<br/>
This change does not affect packages other than the Free package.<br/>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class=sc2gears>January 22, 2014 - Sc2gears 14.3.3</h2>
A quick overview of the new features:
<ul>
	<li><b>Added support for 2.1 replays.</b></li>
	<li>Adjusted the profile retriever to the changes made to Battle.net profile pages so profile data is retrieved correctly again.</li>
	<li>Added Season #17 and #18 start dates.</li>
	<li>Added missing / new portrait images.</li>
	<li>Added links to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/">Scelight&trade;</a>, the successor to Sc2gears (Help menu, Start page, About dialog).</li>
	<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/version-history/sc2gears1433">Read more...</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>NOTES:</b><br>
<i>With this release Sc2gears is being kept up-to-date, but no new features have been added for quite some time now: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/">Scelight&trade;</a> is the one being in the focus of development.<br>
Although Scelight might lack some features that Sc2gears has or provides (yet), but the ones that are implemented are far superior to those of Sc2gears'. Scelight already has numerous features that Sc2gears never had.<br>
It is recommended for everyone to get to know Scelight and get ready to completely switch over to Scelight one day. The sooner you make the switch the better.<br></i>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="design">December 5, 2013 - Scelight 1.0 - The first public release</h2>

I still have a long way ahead, but the current version is already useful enough to be shared. It is also better for everyone to give / get feedback earlier.<br>

<h2 class="info">April 4 - Sc2gears turns 3!</h2>
<b>Yet another year has passed, Sc2gears celebrates its 3<sup>rd</sup> birthday!</b><br/>
<br/>
In the last year (since the 2nd birthday) <b>17 major releases</b> of Sc2gears were published; <b>21 including minor releases</b> (that's about 1 major release in every 3 weeks!).<br/>
<br/>

As a reminder, the statistics for the 2nd year: 27 major releases, 36 including minor releases. And in the first year: 21 major releases, 31 including minor releases.<br/>
This adds up to a total of: <b><span style="color:red">65 major releases; 88 including minor releases!</span></b><br/>
<br/>
Last year also brought us <b>Sharing and Team support</b> in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/sc2gears-database">Sc2gears Database</a>, and the Sc2gears Database has been <b>opened to everyone</b> by presenting a tiny registration form on the <a href="https://sciigears.appspot.com/User.html">User Page</a> to those without an account requiring only 30 seconds to get started with a free account.<br/>
Last year is also the beginning of a new era: Heart of the Swarm. Sc2gears has been equipped to <b>fully support HotS replays</b> and changes that came with HotS.<br/>
And last but not least the long awaited feature, the <b>Historical league info</b> has been added and integrated everywhere in Sc2gears. Sc2gears can display the leagues of players at the time of the game, and you can also filter games by league match-up and see league statistics in the Multi-replay analysis.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Everyone for the continuous support and feedback!<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="sc2gears">March 25 - Sc2gears 14.1</h2>
A quick overview of the new features:
<ul>
	<li><b>League match-up and league match-up filter in the Sc2gears Database.</b></li>
	<li>Mouse Print (SMPD) version 1.1.</li>
	<li>Shortened URLs (addresses) in the Sc2gears Database.</li>
	<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/version-history/sc2gears141-1">And more...</a></li>
</ul>
The league match-up info and search in the <a href="https://sciigears.appspot.com/User.html">Sc2gears Database User Page</a> is only available for replays uploaded with Sc2gears 14.1+.
<br/><i>Re-upload all your 2.0+ replays and you will see the league info and will be able to search by league match-up.</i><br/>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gears">March 19 - Sc2gears 14.0 - Historical League info and Integration!</h2>
A quick overview of the new features:
<ul>
	<li><b>Improved replay parser engine.</b>
		<br/>Historical League info and Swarm levels are parsed from replays.</li>
	<li>Players in the Replay analyzer are now displayed with a colored border based on the 1v1 league <i>at the time of the game</i>.</li>
	<li>Leagues in the Replay search.</li>
	<li>Search by league match-up.</li>
	<li>League match-ups in Multi-replay analysis!</li>
	<li>New name template symbol: /Bx to insert the leage of a player.</li>
	<li>Plugin API 4.2</li>
	<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/version-history/sc2gears140">And more...</a></li>
</ul>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gears">March 14 - Sc2gears 13.1</h2>
A quick overview of the new features:
<ul>
	<li><b>Improved replay parser engine.</b>
		<br/>Expansion level (HotS or WoL), proper map hash parsing, slightly modified EAPM, added missing ability codes.</li>
	<li>Optimization, new portrait and ability images, bug fixes.</li>
	<li>Plugin API 4.1</li>
	<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/version-history/sc2gears131">Read more...</a></li>
</ul>
Due to previous incorrect map parsing it is strongly recommended to re-upload all HotS and old custom replays to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/sc2gears-database">Sc2gears Database</a>.
<br/> Easiest way is to just re-upload all your replays (the database detects if a replay is already stored and will only update it, not store it duplicated).
<br/> Just list all your replays, right click and choose "Store replays".<br/> 
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">March 7 - Mouse print image preview in the Sc2gears Database </h2>
The Sc2gears Database now supports previewing mouse print images without having to download and open them in Sc2gears.<br/>
<br/>
The <b>Mouse prints page</b> of the <a href="https://sciigears.appspot.com/User.html">Sc2gears Database User Page</a> lists your uploaded mouse prints.<br/>
The Actions column now displays an image icon for each mouse prints whose tool tip says: <i>"Preview mouse print image"</i>. Clicking on it will open the mouse print image in a dialog window.<br/>
The mouse prints table now also has a File size column.<br/>
<br/>
These preview images are generated by the Sc2gears Database, you don't have to upload mouse print images (just the mouse print data files (*.SMPD)).<br/>
Also note that these preview images are generated on-the-fly and are not stored, so they don't use your storage quota.<br/>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gears">February 28 - Sc2gears 13.0 - Heart of the Swarm!</h2>

		<br/>You can install Java 7 from here: <a href="http://java.com/">http://java.com/</a></li>
	<li><b>HotS replays are now finally fully supported.</b></li>
