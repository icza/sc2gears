<h2 class=sc2gears>October 7, 2015 - Patch 3.0 - The END of Sc2gears</h2>
StarCraft II's Patch 3.0 rendered Sc2gears' parsing engine incapable of doing its work. In short: Sc2gears can no longer parse replays since Patch 3.0.<br/>
<br/>
No further updates will be released for Sc2gears, only <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/">Scelight</a> will be maintained. Visit the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/">Scelight home page</a> and start using it.<br/>

<b>&#10014; R.I.P. Sc2gears! Lived 5 years, 6 months and 5 days! (April 2, 2010 - October 7, 2015)</b><br/>
<br/>
May God bless You All.<br/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">July 15, 2015 - The Sc2gears Database is shutting down</h2>
The Sc2gears Database is shutting down. As of now, no new accounts can be created.<br/>
<br/>
On <b>July 28th, 2015</b> starting at 12pm Pacific Time, the Sc2gears Database will be unavailable for 24 hours.<br/>
On <b>August 4th, 2015</b> the Sc2gears Database will be permanently shut down at 12:00pm Pacific time.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for shutting down the Sc2gears Database is because it is built using a service of the Google App Engine Platform which will be shut down at the mentioned times.<br/>
<br/>
There will be no more Sc2gears releases. Currently Sc2gears supports only WoL and HotS, and it doesn't support LotV. And this will remain this way.<br/>
Most likely when LotV is released, Sc2gears will stop functioning for all replays (including WoL, HotS and LotV) due to replay format changes.<br/>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">March 9 - Sc2gears Database Free Package Quota Decreased</h2>
The Quota of the Free Sc2gears Database package has been decreased from 50 MB to <span style='text-decoration:line-through;color:#666666'>10</span> <b>5 MB</b>.<br/>
Replays and files that you have already uploaded and are over the quota are not deleted yet. You have 3 weeks to review your package.<br/>
<br/>
Starting on April 1, 2014, files may be deleted of accounts with the Free package that are over the 100% of their quota.<br/>
<br/>
This change does not affect packages other than the Free package.<br/>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class=sc2gears>January 22, 2014 - Sc2gears 14.3.3</h2>
A quick overview of the new features:
<ul>
	<li><b>Added support for 2.1 replays.</b></li>
	<li>Adjusted the profile retriever to the changes made to Battle.net profile pages so profile data is retrieved correctly again.</li>
	<li>Added Season #17 and #18 start dates.</li>
	<li>Added missing / new portrait images.</li>
	<li>Added links to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/">Scelight&trade;</a>, the successor to Sc2gears (Help menu, Start page, About dialog).</li>
	<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/version-history/sc2gears1433">Read more...</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>NOTES:</b><br>
<i>With this release Sc2gears is being kept up-to-date, but no new features have been added for quite some time now: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/">Scelight&trade;</a> is the one being in the focus of development.<br>
Although Scelight might lack some features that Sc2gears has or provides (yet), but the ones that are implemented are far superior to those of Sc2gears'. Scelight already has numerous features that Sc2gears never had.<br>
It is recommended for everyone to get to know Scelight and get ready to completely switch over to Scelight one day. The sooner you make the switch the better.<br></i>
<br/><hr/>

<br/><b><i>Happy Birthday Sc2gears!</i></b><br/>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="info">April 4 - Sc2gears turns 3!</h2>
<b>Yet another year has passed, Sc2gears celebrates its 3<sup>rd</sup> birthday!</b><br/>
<br/>
In the last year (since the 2nd birthday) <b>17 major releases</b> of Sc2gears were published; <b>21 including minor releases</b> (that's about 1 major release in every 3 weeks!).<br/>
<br/>

As a reminder, the statistics for the 2nd year: 27 major releases, 36 including minor releases. And in the first year: 21 major releases, 31 including minor releases.<br/>
This adds up to a total of: <b><span style="color:red">65 major releases; 88 including minor releases!</span></b><br/>
<br/>
Last year also brought us <b>Sharing and Team support</b> in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/sc2gears-database">Sc2gears Database</a>, and the Sc2gears Database has been <b>opened to everyone</b> by presenting a tiny registration form on the <a href="https://sciigears.appspot.com/User.html">User Page</a> to those without an account requiring only 30 seconds to get started with a free account.<br/>
Last year is also the beginning of a new era: Heart of the Swarm. Sc2gears has been equipped to <b>fully support HotS replays</b> and changes that came with HotS.<br/>
And last but not least the long awaited feature, the <b>Historical league info</b> has been added and integrated everywhere in Sc2gears. Sc2gears can display the leagues of players at the time of the game, and you can also filter games by league match-up and see league statistics in the Multi-replay analysis.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Everyone for the continuous support and feedback!<br/>
<br/>
<b><i>Despite the long history and success of Sc2gears, most players still don't know about it.<br/>

<h2 class="sc2gears">March 25 - Sc2gears 14.1</h2>
A quick overview of the new features:
<ul>
	<li><b>League match-up and league match-up filter in the Sc2gears Database.</b></li>
	<li>Mouse Print (SMPD) version 1.1.</li>
	<li>Shortened URLs (addresses) in the Sc2gears Database.</li>
	<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/version-history/sc2gears141-1">And more...</a></li>
</ul>
The league match-up info and search in the <a href="https://sciigears.appspot.com/User.html">Sc2gears Database User Page</a> is only available for replays uploaded with Sc2gears 14.1+.
<br/><i>Re-upload all your 2.0+ replays and you will see the league info and will be able to search by league match-up.</i><br/>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gears">March 19 - Sc2gears 14.0 - Historical League info and Integration!</h2>
A quick overview of the new features:
<ul>
	<li><b>Improved replay parser engine.</b>
		<br/>Historical League info and Swarm levels are parsed from replays.</li>
	<li>Players in the Replay analyzer are now displayed with a colored border based on the 1v1 league <i>at the time of the game</i>.</li>
	<li>Leagues in the Replay search.</li>
	<li>Search by league match-up.</li>
	<li>League match-ups in Multi-replay analysis!</li>
	<li>New name template symbol: /Bx to insert the leage of a player.</li>
	<li>Plugin API 4.2</li>
	<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/version-history/sc2gears140">And more...</a></li>
</ul>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gears">March 14 - Sc2gears 13.1</h2>
A quick overview of the new features:
<ul>
	<li><b>Improved replay parser engine.</b>
		<br/>Expansion level (HotS or WoL), proper map hash parsing, slightly modified EAPM, added missing ability codes.</li>
	<li>Optimization, new portrait and ability images, bug fixes.</li>
	<li>Plugin API 4.1</li>
	<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/version-history/sc2gears131">Read more...</a></li>
</ul>
Due to previous incorrect map parsing it is strongly recommended to re-upload all HotS and old custom replays to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/sc2gears-database">Sc2gears Database</a>.
<br/> Easiest way is to just re-upload all your replays (the database detects if a replay is already stored and will only update it, not store it duplicated).
<br/> Just list all your replays, right click and choose "Store replays".<br/> 
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">March 7 - Mouse print image preview in the Sc2gears Database </h2>
The Sc2gears Database now supports previewing mouse print images without having to download and open them in Sc2gears.<br/>
<br/>
The <b>Mouse prints page</b> of the <a href="https://sciigears.appspot.com/User.html">Sc2gears Database User Page</a> lists your uploaded mouse prints.<br/>
The Actions column now displays an image icon for each mouse prints whose tool tip says: <i>"Preview mouse print image"</i>. Clicking on it will open the mouse print image in a dialog window.<br/>
The mouse prints table now also has a File size column.<br/>
<br/>
These preview images are generated by the Sc2gears Database, you don't have to upload mouse print images (just the mouse print data files (*.SMPD)).<br/>
Also note that these preview images are generated on-the-fly and are not stored, so they don't use your storage quota.<br/>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gears">February 28 - Sc2gears 13.0 - Heart of the Swarm!</h2>

<h2 class="sc2gears">February 22 - Sc2gears 12.5</h2>
A quick overview of the new features:
<ul>
	<li><b>Updated the replay parser engine to handle replay versions 2.0.4.</b>
		<br/>The new engine is NOT HotS ready, but it is able to handle HotS replays to a good extent (including most player actions too).</li>
	<li><b>Updated the Player profile engine to reflect the new data available on the Battle.net pages.</b></li>
	<li>New portrait images have been added.</li>
	<li>Added 2 new name template symbols: <b>/v</b> for short replay version and <b>/b</b> for replay version build number.</li>

Further improvements were made to the <a href="https://sciigears.appspot.com/User.html">Sc2gears Database User Page</a>, including the following:<br/>
<ul>
	<li><b>Match-up filter.</b> Finds all permutations too (e.g. searching for "TPvPZ" will also find "ZPvPT" games). Also works for FFA games (e.g. "PvTvZvZ").<br/>
		Now the match-ups in the replays table and on the replay details popup dialogs are links which when clicked will set the match-up as the match-up filter.</li>
	<li><b>Comment filter.</b> You can now filter replays where you set a private comment ("HAS COMMENT"), or where you did not set a private comment ("NO COMMENT").</li>
	<li>Changed the "Edit comment" icon for replays which already have a comment to make it more obvious.</li>
	<li>Added 3 new labels increasing max label count to 13. Have fun tagging replays :)<br/>
		Tip: you can also view/edit private comments and tag replays on the "Private data" tab of the Replay analyzer in Sc2gears.</li>
</ul>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">September 4 - Improved filtering on the Sc2gears Database User Page</h2>
The file listing and filtering has been improved on the <a href="https://sciigears.appspot.com/User.html">Sc2gears Database User Page</a> with the following:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Now every file type (Replays, Mouse prints and Other files) can be filtered by date (specifying a range: from, to).</li>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">July 3 - Sc2gears Database - Open to Everyone!</h2>
Today the Sc2gears Database is made open to everyone. By visiting the <a href="https://sciigears.appspot.com/User.html">Sc2gears Database User Page</a> you can create your own account in <b>30 seconds</b>!<br/>
<br/>
If you visit the User Page and you don't already have an Sc2gears Database account, a tiny registration form will be displayed to you. With that, you can create your own account literally in 30 seconds.<br/> 
<br/>
This registration process will create a Free account for you which you can upgrade at any time if you want to, of course. You can read the details on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/sc2gears-database">Sc2gears Database</a> page.<br/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">June 28 - Further improvements to the Sc2gears Database User Page</h2>
The <i>"Favored Player List"</i> feature was launched just a week ago, already further improvements were already made to the <a href="https://sciigears.appspot.com/User.html">Sc2gears Database User Page</a>:<br/>
<ul>
	<li><i>"Display replay winners"</i> setting which specifies how to display winners on the Replays page.<br/>
		Possible values: Hide, Icons, Colored names, Icons + Colored names<br/>
		The <i>"Colored names"</i> is the new default version which indicates winners as green links and losers as red links, the <i>"Icons"</i> is the old version displaying different icons next to winners and losers. The <i>"Icons + Color names"</i> combines these 2 visual effects.</li>
	<li>Storage quota status and related warnings are displayed on the Home page.</li>
	<li>More elastic layout which suits devices with smaller display better (e.g. cell phones) and which displays wide replay tables nicer by breaking lines and removing horizontal scroll bars.</li>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">May 15 - Sharing and Team Support in the Sc2gears Database</h2>
<br/>
<b><i>HELL! IT'S ABOUT TIME!</i></b><br/>
<br/>
Today I introduce a new feature in the Sc2gears Database: <b>Database Account Sharing!</b><br/>
<br/>
You can now share your Sc2gears Database Account with other Google Accounts and they will be able to use your storage and access your content as it would be theirs (controlled by permissions).<br/>
You can set permissions for each granted Google Account individually fine tuning who can do and what within the shared database account.<br/>
<br/>
The new Sharing feature makes the Sc2gears Database <b>ideal for StarCraft II teams to store and share their replays</b> with the team.<br/>
<br/>
Let the new Sc2gears Database shine! Read the details on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/sc2gears-database">Sc2gears Database</a> page.<br/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">April 18 - Sc2gears Database Migration Case Closed</h2>
The Sc2gears Database Server migration from M/S datastore to HRD datastore is now complete. All your previous files (stored before the migration) are "back again".<br/>
<br/>
The migration post-task was actually a bug of the migration tool which has been resolved.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Let the new HRD datastore shine</b> which provides the <i>highest level of availability</i> and <i>much better performance</i>.<br/>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">April 14 - Sc2gears Database Migration Status Report</h2>
The Sc2gears Database Server is being migrated from M/S datastore to HRD datastore. This migration started on April 11 and finished before midnight of April 11.<br/>
There was only a 10-minute read-only period where uploaded replays were rejected. This period took place at around 11 PM (CEST) on April 11. Excluding this short 10-minute period every replay sent to the database were stored properly. If you attempted to store replays around the specified time period, please double check if they got stored properly, if not, simply store them again.<br/>
<br/>
There is a post-task which needs to be completed in order so your previous replays will be accessible. Replays stored after the migration are placed right in the new HRD datastore so they are downloadable. Previous replays (stored before the migration) are listed but not yet downloadable. They will be "back" when the post migration task is completed.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your patience. This new HRD datastore provides the <i>highest level of availability</i> and <i>much better performance</i>.<br/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">March 8 - Sc2gears Database Issues</h2>
On January 30 there was a news stating that the Sc2gears Database service had issues.<br/>
These issues arose from a platform service the server used to access the storage layer. It appeared this platform issue had been fixed, but it wasn't.<br/>
This means that if you uploaded replays or other files since January 15, there is a slight change they did not get stored (error was reported back in these cases).<br/>
<br/>
Because of this <b>I developed a double-caching storage mechanism which now provides fail-safe file storing operations</b>. If the primary storage is not available, the uploaded file (e.g. replay) will be stored on a secondary storage which is independent from the primary storage. The secondary storage is not affected by the problem mentioned earlier.<br/>
The secondary storage is synchronized to the primary automatically in the background.<br/>
<br/>
It is recommended to check if you have missing files. The easiest thing is just to re-upload all your replays and mouse prints that you attempted to store since January 16. The server will recognize if you already have the file and will not store it duplicated.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Again, the error was not in the code of the Sc2gears Database</i> but in the services that was used by it, but I apologize for the inconvenience anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<b>The double-caching storage mechanism will now handle even future errors. The Sc2gears Database operates fail-safe from now on.</b><br/>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">February 28 - New Profile info operation in the Parsing service</h2>

<h2 class="design">January 30 - Parsing Service, is there a need for it?</h2>
<b>Replay Site Admins, Attention!</b><br/>
<br/>
I'm planning to open a parsing service where you could post a replay to a URL, and you could get back all kinds of information about the replay including basic info (like players, races, map name, duration, winners etc), the in-game chat of the players, and advanced info like the complete action list of players.<br/>
Or you could query the map preview image of of a replay based on the map file name info of a replay.<br/>
<br/>
The service would not be free, a customer would have to pay based on usage (the number of API calls).<br/>
<br/>
<b>Benefits:</b> you could operate a replay site without the need of a replay parser engine. Or you could use this service to validate your data. Or you might have your own replay parser engine, but you could use this to get advanced details about a game your engine is not capable of. This service would also get the computing load off of your server, and you could concentrate on your site's design and logic (and leave the replay parsing logic to me).<br/>
This would not require any technology on your server (like Java) as all API calls would be standard HTTP or HTTPS requests/responses. The responses would be likely XML or JSON (or plain text).<br/>
<br/>
<b>My question: Is there a need for a Parsing Service like this?</b><br/>
If you would be interested in using this Parsing service, please let me know by sending an email to me (my email is on the About dialog), and please describe in short what you would expect from a service like this.<br/>
<br/><hr/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">January 30 - Sc2gears Database Service Disturbance</h2>
Between <b>January 15 and January 26</b> storage services that the Sc2gears Database builds on experienced some issues.<br/>
This means that if you uploaded files during this period, there is a slight chance that a small part of your uploaded files did not get stored (of course the server returned an error in these cases).<br/>
<br/>
It is recommended to check if you have missing files from uploads during this period. The <i>easiest thing</i> is to just re-upload all files that you uploaded during this period, the Sc2gears Database detects if a file is already stored and will not store it duplicated.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The error was not in the code of the Sc2gears Database</i> but in the services that was used by it, but I apologize for the inconvenience anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<b>The issue has been taken care of, the Sc2gears Database operates fully functional since January 26.</b><br/>

<h2 class="sc2gearsdb">October 11 - Sc2gears Database Starter package</h2>
I've introduced a new Starter Sc2gears Database package for a price of just 2 USD (one-time fee, no recurring monthly costs). The Starter package comes with 200 MB storage space which is enough for approximately 4,000 replays.<br/>
This can be ideal for those who:
<ul>
	<li>just want to store some of their replays</li>
	<li>don't play much and 200 MB (~4,000 replays) is enough</li>
	<li>want to try out the service first before spending more on it</li>
</ul>
With the Starter package you can take advantage of other current and future services that comes with the Sc2gears Database (like submitting your Mouse practice scores).<br/>
You can upgrade your package at any time of course. Details are on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/sc2gears-database">Sc2gears Database</a> page.<br/>

<h2 class="design">October 19 - Replay upload idea and specification draft</h2>
I think it would be cool if Sc2gears had a feature where you could right click on a replay and choose <i>"Upload replay to site"</i> and select a replay site.<br/>
I can't implement the different upload methods of every replay site, so I made a specification draft of how I would imagine the replay upload feature in Sc2gears. Every replay site that implements it would be added to Sc2gears to be available to upload replays to.<br/>
<br/>
Replay site admins would you be interested in this?<br/>
Please read it: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=121ZFAahJjvGEd2rt-vj5BeOVOiRmlYc9FticKDlsEA0">Sc2gears replay upload specification - Early Draft</a> and comment on it in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sc2gears">Official Sc2gears forum</a>.<br/>

<h2 class="blizzard">September 22, 2010 - Patch 1.1</h2>
Blizzard&trade; released Patch 1.1 for StarCraft II which changed the replay format. Sc2gears cannot yet handle 1.1 replays. I'm working on the update.<br/>
Replay auto-save and replay renaming still works.<br/>
