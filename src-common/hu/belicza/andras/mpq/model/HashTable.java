/**
 * <p>The Hash table section of the MPQ archives.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Instead of storing file names, for quick access MoPaQs use a fixed, power of two-size hash table
 * of files in the archive. A file is uniquely identified by its file path, its language, and its platform.<br>
 * <br>
 * The home entry for a file in the hash table is computed as a hash of the file path.
 * In the event of a collision (the home entry is occupied by another file), progressive overflow is used,
 * and the file is placed in the next available hash table entry. Searches for a desired file in the hash table
 * proceed from the home entry for the file until either the file is found, the entire hash table is searched,
 * or an empty hash table entry (FileBlockIndex of 0xFFFFFFFF) is encountered.<br>
 * <br>
 * The hash table is always encrypted, using the hash of "(hash table)" as the key.<br>
 * <br>
 * Prior to Starcraft 2, the hash table is stored uncompressed. In Starcraft 2, however,
 * the table may optionally be compressed. If the offset of the block table is not equal to the offset of the hash table
 * plus the uncompressed size, Starcraft 2 interprets the hash table as being compressed (not imploded).
 * This calculation assumes that the block table immediately follows the hash table, and will fail or crash otherwise.<br>
 * <br>
 * Each entry is structured as follows (see below):</p>
