 * <p>The header of the MPQ archives.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The archive header is the first structure in the archive, at archive offset 0;
 * however, the archive does not need to be at offset 0 of the containing file.
 * The offset of the archive in the file is referred to here as ArchiveOffset.
 * If the archive is not at the beginning of the file, it must begin at a disk sector boundary (512 bytes).
 * Early versions of Storm require that the archive be at the end of the containing file
 * (ArchiveOffset + ArchiveSize = file size), but this is not required in newer versions
 * (due to the strong digital signature not being considered a part of the archive).</p>
