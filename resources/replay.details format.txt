So the replay.details file looks like an xml file, except it's coded funny. The rightmost bit is usually some sort of flag,
0 is default, 1 is special. Thus most numerical values need to be divided by two

0x05 indicates the beginning of an array of items, which can be hierarchical and contain other arrays.
the byte after that is the number of fields. Then each field is numbered 0x00, 0x02, 0x04, etc., and after each one is an opcode

some opcodes:
0x02 = variable length string, length immediately follows
0x09 = single byte item (see next paragraph)
0x04 = a number of identical items
0x05 = an array as before

so the first few bytes are
05 1c 00 04 01 00 20

array with (1c = 14) elements. The first item is numbered 00, and is followed by 04 01 00 20.
This is a collection of items with (20 = 16), players in this case

similarly, players begin
05 12 00 02 0x "name"

array with (12 = 9) items. The first one is a variable length string with 0x/2 length. It's followed by the name of the player.

actually for numerical values, the leftmost bit is a flag for more bits...
so that value = (value[0] & 0b01111110) + (value[1] & 0b1111110 << 6) + (value[2] & 0b1111110 << 7)
and so on as long as the leftmost bit is 1. For example, color (alpha transparency) looks like
00 09 fe 03

this the first item of the players metadata array. 09 indicates "single" byte. fe 03 = 11111110 00000011 = 11111111 = 255
