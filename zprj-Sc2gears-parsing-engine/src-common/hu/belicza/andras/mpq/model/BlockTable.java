/**
 * <p>The Block table section of the MPQ archives.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The block table contains entries for each region in the archive. Regions may be either files,
 * empty space, which may be overwritten by new files (typically this space is from deleted file data),
 * or unused block table entries. Empty space entries should have BlockOffset and BlockSize nonzero,
 * and FileSize and Flags zero; unused block table entries should have BlockSize, FileSize, and Flags zero.
 * The block table is encrypted, using the hash of "(block table)" as the key. Each entry is structured as follows: (see below)</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Extended block table</b><br>
 * The extended block table was added to support archives larger than 4 gigabytes (2^32 bytes).
 * The table contains the upper bits of the archive offsets for each block in the block table.
 * It is simply an array of int16s, which become bits 32-47 of the archive offsets for each block,
 * with bits 48-63 being zero. Individual blocks in the archive are still limited to 4 gigabytes in size.
 * This table is only present in Burning Crusade format archives that exceed 4 gigabytes size.<br>
 * <br>
 * Unlike the hash and block tables, the extended block table is not encrypted nor compressed.</p>
