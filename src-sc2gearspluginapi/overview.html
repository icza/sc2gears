This API documentation is about the Sc2gears plugin interface.

<p>Contains the interface that a plugin must implement, a base implementation of this plugin interface,
the APIs and services that are provided for the plugins to use including many utilities (so there's a good chance
you will not need any external libraries/jars), and some small examples to show how to use various methods and components.</p>

<p>You can find Sc2gears here: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/" target="_blank">Sc2gears home page</a></p>
<hr/>

<p>Plugins are written using the Java language. There are no restrictions, everything can be used from the public Java API.
Since the Java requirement of Sc2gears is 7.0, for the sake of portability it is highly recommended to use only the Java API 7.0
(and not newer versions).
Plugins can write to the standard output (<code>System.out</code>) or to the standard error (<code>System.err</code>),
they will appear in the application Log (<code>"User Content/Logs"</code> folder).</p>

<p>A plugin is a set of files within a folder. It must contain a <i>plugin descriptor</i> file
and java libraries (*.jar files) that contain the code of the plugin - in simple cases it can be one jar file.
All Java libraries (*.jar) in the plugin folder will be loaded and will be available for the plugin.
Classes may only be loaded once, keep that in mind if you plan to use static attributes and initializers
(static initializers may only run once and static attributes may only be initialized once).<br>
The Plugin API library must not be included in the plugin jars, because it is contained in Sc2gears!</p>

<p>The plugin descriptor is an XML file which must be in the root of the plugin folder and must be named <code>"Sc2gears-plugin.xml"</code>,
and contains meta-data about the plugin including the plugin name, author, description and main class.</p>

Here is an example of <code>"Sc2gears-plugin.xml"</code>:
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;!-- Plugin descriptor, contains plugin meta-data. --&gt;
&lt;plugin docVersion="1.0"&gt;
	
	&lt;name&gt;Test plugin&lt;/name&gt;
	
	&lt;authorFirstName&gt;Andr&aacute;s&lt;/authorFirstName&gt;
	&lt;authorLastName&gt;Belicza&lt;/authorLastName&gt;
	&lt;authorEmail&gt;someemail@somesite.com&lt;/authorEmail&gt;
	
	&lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;
	&lt;releaseDate&gt;2011-07-21&lt;/releaseDate&gt; &lt;!-- Format: "yyyy-MM-dd" --&gt;
	
	&lt;apiVersion&gt;2.0&lt;/apiVersion&gt; &lt;!-- Plugin API version implemented/used by the plugin. --&gt;
	
	&lt;homePage&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/&lt;/homePage&gt;
	
	&lt;!-- Description can be plain text or HTML text, can contain multiple lines. --&gt;
	&lt;description isHtml="true"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;h2&gt;Hi!&lt;/h2&gt;This is a test plugin with &lt;b&gt;HTML&lt;/b&gt; description. It has no special meaning or function.]]&gt;&lt;/description&gt;
	
	&lt;!--
		The main class must implement the "hu.belicza.andras.sc2gearspluginapi.Plugin" interface,
		and must have a public no-arg constructor (a constructor that takes no arguments).
		
		The main class must also be unique: cannot be added 2 plugins with the same main class!
	--&gt;
	&lt;mainClass&gt;hu.belicza.andras.testplugin.TestPlugin&lt;/mainClass&gt;
	
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The main class must implement the {@link hu.belicza.andras.sc2gearspluginapi.Plugin} interface or extend a class that implements it
(for example {@link hu.belicza.andras.sc2gearspluginapi.impl.BasePlugin}).
Moreover the main class must provide a public no-arg constructor (a constructor that takes no arguments).
</p>

<p>To Sc2gears a plugin is identified by its main class. This means that the main class must be unique: cannot be added 2 plugins
with the same main class. Plugins may store settings and persistent files which will be saved in the plugin's own context.
This plugin context is bound to the main class of the plugin, so the main class cannot be changed.
If the main class of the plugin is changed (the package name and/or the class name), a new context will be assigned to the plugin.
