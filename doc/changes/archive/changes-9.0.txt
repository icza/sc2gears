[b]Changes and new features in 9.0:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-[b]A new Parsing Service has been launched today.[/b]
The Parsing Service is a service of the Sc2gears Database where you can post a replay to a URL, and you can get back all kinds of information about the replay.
Or you can post the name of an StarCraft II map file, and you can get back basic info about the map and the map preview image.

-[b]Added support for newer map formats.[/b]
Map preview image was not displayed for some maps, this is fixed now.

-The "Open replay's folder" file operation menu on Windows now not only opens the replay's folder, but after opening the folder also selects the replay file.

-The "/Mx" name template symbol (which is the first x words of the map name) now skips the first word if it's "The" or "A".

-A progress dialog is displayed while diagnostic tests are running.

-[b]A new menu item in the Window menu: Restore last window position on startup[/b]
If this is enabled (it is by default), Sc2gears will remember and restore the last window position and size on the next startup.
Keep in mind that if "Start maximized" is enabled, Sc2gears will still start maximized.
If "Start minimized to tray" is enabled, window position and size will still be saved and remembered.

-Added Season 6 start date (assumed to be February 14).
