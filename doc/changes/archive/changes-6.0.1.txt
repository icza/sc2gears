[b]Changes and new features in 6.0.1:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-Player full names have been added to the game info tab in the Replay analyzer and to the command line export.

-Removed a debug line that was left in accidentally and which periodically logged file modification dates therefore increasing and cluttering the logs.
