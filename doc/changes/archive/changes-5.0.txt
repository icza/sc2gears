Sc2gears Database

Replays are becoming more and more important as Blizzard has shown that they can and they do hide important statistics arbitrary from Battle.net profile pages. Replays remain your only source to get detailed statistics about your play and improvements.

[b]Sc2gears Database is a secure server to store ALL your replays and other related files privately.[/b]
You do not have to worry anymore about losing your replays or Sc2gears mouse prints. Doesn't matter if your computer crashes, you accidently delete your replays, or someone/something intentionally deletes them from your computer. Your replays are secured online and are accessible from anywhere any time.
With Sc2gears you can upload all your saved replays at once, and it can automatically store your new replays for you on the Sc2gears Database server right after they are saved.

It's secure!
1) Everything is done over a secure connection (HTTPS). Every info and replay is transmitted over a secure connection, hackers who monitor the network traffic are not able to decode it.
2) You are never asked for any password: even Sc2gears Database does not know (does not need to know) your password. Sc2gears communicates with the server with an Authorization key (see below). 
3) Your content is stored duplicated on a secure, distributed network, not on some some private server which lacks security solutions or administrators with proper expertise to handle security and backups. 

The Sc2gears Database uses Google account for authentication. What does this mean?
-Google manages your account and password. They do a lot better job at keeping it safe and secure than anyone else could.
-If you have a GMail account, then you already have a Google Account. If not, you can use any email address to create a Google Account.
-Your password is not given to any 3rd parties (unlike for example a site where you register). Google only provides Sc2gears Database with the info whether you are logged in and with which account.
-If you use other Google products (like GMail or Google Docs) and you are logged in to any of those, you will have access to your Sc2gears Database User Page without having to log in again.

Howto register an account for Sc2gears Database?
1) First you have to create a Google Account if you don't have one.
2) You have to send a minimum payment of 8 USD to my PayPal account (my email is on the About tab inside Sc2gears).
   In the comment section indicate that you want an Sc2gears Database account.
   Note: This is a one-time fee, no monthly costs.
   Note #2: this payment is not for my development efforts. It is to pay for the storage and bandwidth that your replays and other files need.
   Note #3: if you don't have a PayPal account, you can ask a friend of yours to send the money in your name.
TODO implement a form here instead of email!
3) Send me an email (my email is on the About tab inside Sc2gears) with the following details:
   -PayPal account that you sent the money from.
   -Your Google account that you want to access the web interface of Sc2gears Database with.
   -Your contact email in case it differs from the Google account you're signing up with.
4) You're done. You will receive an automated email when your account is ready. The email will contain your Authorization key and the link to your Sc2gears Database User Page.
   You can start uploading your saved replays immediately. Be sure to enable automatic replay storing.

Authorization key
Sc2gears communicates with the Sc2gears Database server using an Authorization key instead of your password.
The authorization key is a secret key known only to its owner and to the Sc2gears Database.
The Authorization key is sent to the users via email after registration, and you can also view your key or generate a new one on the [url!]Sc2gears Database User Page[/url].
If you think your Authorization key might have been compromised, simply generate a new one and change the key in your Sc2gears to the new one.
You can use your Authorization key from multiple computers, but it is your responsibility not to share it with others.


Pricing
The minimum payment (8 USD) comes with 1 GB storage space. This is enough for approximately 15 thousand replays. This is sufficient for the majority.
You can get additional storage for the following prices:

             | Price (1)    | Storage  | # of replays |
Package      |(one-time fee)| (2)      | (3)          | Replays stored for $1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bronze       | 8 USD        | 1 GB     | 16,000       | 2,000
Silver       | 15 USD       | 2 GB     | 32,000       | 2,133
Gold         | 29 USD       | 4 GB     | 64,000       | 2,206  
Platinum     | 42 USD       | 6 GB     | 96,000       | 2,285
Diamond      | 54 USD       | 8 GB     | 128,000      | 2,370
Master       | 65 USD       | 10 GB    | 160,000      | 2,461
(1) Prices indicate a one-time fee, there are no recurring monthly costs. Prices include the costs of all necessary resources (storage, incoming and outgoing bandwidth, CPU).
(2) Storage conversion: 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes
(3) The number of replays is an approximation. Size of replays depends on its length, number of players, number of actions.
You can request even more storage if the Master package is not enough for you.
You can upgrade your current package at any time by sending the price difference (for example if you paid 8 USD for 1 GB and you want 2 GB, you have to send 15-8=7 USD to upgrade to 2 GB).

Terms of Service
Last updated: 2011-04-13
1) The payment is not refundable. You can't change your mind and request the money back.
2) If the service is terminated in the future, you can claim the proportional amount of your payment projected to 2 years. For example if you register today and the service gets shut down a year from now, you can claim half of your payment.
3) Price changes do not effect currently paid packages. If you want to upgrade to a higher package, it will require a payment of the difference to the new price. 
4) Accounts that are inactive for 1 year may be subject to deletion. An email is sent to the account 1 month prior to the deletion to inform the user and give possibility to show activity. 
5) Accounts abusing the service will be suspended and/or deleted. This includes -but is not limited to- sharing an Authorization key with others or generating unreasonably high traffic. Note that the owner of the key may use it from multiple computers.
6) I reserve the right to change the terms.

-I deleted some files but they are still included on the Quota page!
When you delete files they are deleted immediately. The info displayed on the quota page is refreshed asynchronously. Give the Quota page a few seconds (or minutes) to get updated.

-What happens if I upload the same files multiple times?
Sc2gears Database detects if a file with the same content has been uploaded before, and will not store it again. The content of the file is what matters: if you upload 2 different files with the same name, they will be stored separately. If you upload 2 identical files with different names, it will be detected and stored only once.
