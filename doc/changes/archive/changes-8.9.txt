-[b]Map attributes are now parsed and displayed on the Map preview tab in the Replay analyzer.[/b]
Map attributes include Map name, Author, short and long description. You can choose to display map attributes from all the available languages/locales.

-If a replay cannot be parsed fully due to errors, a [b]"Parsing error!"[/b] text is displayed above the action list in the Replay analyzer.

-[b]Plugin API 2.7. Changes and additions:[/b]
 * NewReplayListener is replaced by ReplayAutosaveListener (the new one also passes the auto-saved replay file; the old one has been deprecated).
 * New enum value: ReplayFactoryApi.ReplayContent.MAP_ATTRIBUTES
 * Several new methods in IMapInfo to access map attributes of a replay.
 * New methods in InfoApi to get player alias and map alias info.
 * New method in IReplay to get the origin of the replay (where/how the replay was assembled).
 * New method: IGameEvents.isErrorParsing() which tells if there were errors parsing the game events.
