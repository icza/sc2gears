[b]Changes and new features in 5.3:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-[b]1.3.3 replays are now fully supported.[/b]
Also improved the replay parser of the previous versions.

-[b]Profile integration[/b]
The replay analyzer now automatically downloads profile info from Sc2ranks.com, and displays the portrait and icons the best leagues for each ranked match-up.
The profile info is downloaded asynchronously in the background. The replay analyzer is opened right away, and profile info will be displayed right when they are ready.
If a player is a computer, a computer icon is displayed as the portrait and the difficulty level is displayed instead of the best leagues.
If you move your mouse over a player's portrait or league icons, a tool tip text will list advanced profile info like achievement points and all ranked team info (without members).
You can change and disable the profile info: on the Analyzer tab of the Misc settings dialog you can set how to show profile info: [i]"Portrait and Leagues"[/i], [i]"Leagues only"[/i], [i]"None"[/i].
A Profile cache is managed automatically by Sc2gears to minimize the Profile info queries. You can set the profile info validity time on the Internal tab of the Misc settings dialog.
If your profile is not in the Sc2ranks.com database, you will see [i]"NA"[/i] icons instead of your profile data. To display your profile info, add yourself to the Sc2ranks.com database.

-[b]Winner detection has been improved! Match results, records and win ratio values are now more accurate![/b]
Most of the unknown results should be gone now.

-Fixed a bug which caused incorrect overlay map view if the main chart was zoomed.

-Fixed a bug which caused an error when Hot areas or Camera areas was selected as the background in the Map view chart.

-Other minor changes and improvements.
