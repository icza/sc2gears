[b]Changes and new features in 12.5:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-[b]Updated the replay parser engine to handle replay versions 2.0.4.[/b]
The new engine is NOT HotS ready, but it is able to handle HotS replays to a good extent (including most player actions too).

-[b]Updated the Player profile engine to reflect the new data available on the Battle.net pages.[/b]
This involves: player profile dialog, player tool tip in the Replay analyzer and in the On-top last game info dialog.

-New portrait images have been added.

-Added 2 new name template symbols.
[b]/v[/b] will insert the short replay version (e.g. "2.0.4").
[b]/b[/b] will insert the replay version build number (e.g. 24944).
Concatenating the 2 will yield the whole version: "/v./b" => "2.0.4.24944"

-Fixed ladder season start dates (season #11 and #12).

-Player names in the Player profile dialog are now links to the Battle.net profile page (in the preferred language set in the User interface tab of the Misc settings dialog).

-The [url=https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/parsing-service]Parsing Service[/url] has also been updated with the new replay parser engine and with the new player profile engine to reflect the new data available on the battle.net profile pages.

-Plugin API 3.1: backward incompatible changes!
 *Changed the IProfile and related interfaces to reflect the new data available on the battle.net profile pages.

-Other minor changes, improvements and fixes.
