[b]Changes since version 1.00:[/b]
----------------------------------
-Added [b]tool tips[/b] to the charts. By default it shows the frame and time.
On the Hotkeys chart it shows the current selection in case of hotkey assigns.
On the Builds/Tech charts tool tips show the name of the icons/bars.

-A new option on the Builds/Tech chart: [b]"Use icons"[/b]. If it is checked, icons will be displayed on the chart instead of the names, but tool tips will show the names.

-The File date column of replay list/search results now shows the [b]date+time[/b] (instead of just the date).

-A new menu item: [b]"Allow only one instace"[/b]. If this is checked, Sc2gears will only run in one instance. Attempting to open a new instance will bring the running instance to front.
If you double click on an SC2Replay (and it is associated with Sc2gears), the replay will open in the (only) running instance.

-Added [b]2 new symbols[/b] to the replay rename template: 'd' for the date of the replay files, 'D' for the date and time of the replay files

-Player name search field now allows a [b]comma separated list[/b] of names. If multiple names are provided, they are connected with logical AND: all listed names must be in the replay.
