[b]Changes and new features in 12.1:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-Reverted the Plugin API 3.0 "incompatibility classification".
This means that plugins below version 3.0 will still start without manually enabling incompatible plugins, but they may fail at any time if they use the incompatible changed interfaces.

-Failed abilities are back in the charts and statistics and again counted in replay search...
...but they are still excluded from the EAPM calculation.
