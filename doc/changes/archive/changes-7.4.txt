Sc2gears 7.4: The Sound of Victory plugin, Plugin API 2.1


[b]Changes and new features in 7.4:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-[b]A new "The Sound of Victory" plugin[/b]
Do you miss your favorite sound to praise you when you win? Or do you miss something to cheer you up when you lose? Then this plugin is for You.
This plugin plays an audio file after each of your games based on your match result (win or loss). You can choose your own Victory and Defeat audio files.
Replay auto-save must be enabled for this plugin to work.

-[b]Plugin API 2.1[/b]
An overview of the Plugin API 2.1 changes and additions:
 * A new [i]Configurable[/i] interface which if implemented will be called when the user clicks on the [i]"Configure plugin"[/i] button in the Plugin manager.
 * Fixed a bug which caused an error when a plugin tried to set or get a setting through the SettingsApi.
 * The SoundsApi now accepts data streams which do not support mark().
 * Fixed many typos in the API documentation.
 * Fixed some bugs in the API implementation.

-Setting the APM Alert level to zero will disable APM alerts "Low APM" and "APM ok." (but will let the APM Alert monitor run).

-Replaced the Win icon and added a Loss icon.

-Winners and losers are now displayed in the On-Top Game info dialog.

-League wins ("LW") are now displayed in the On-Top Game info dialog next to the APM.

-Improved the replay parser engine (replays are now handled properly where the in-game chat parsing failed).

-Other minor changes, bug fixes and improvements.
