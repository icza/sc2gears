[b]Changes and new features in 7.2:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-[b]Plugin API 2.0[/b]
The Sc2gears Plugin API 2.0 allows to create more powerful plugins which better integrate into Sc2gears.
The main addition is that plugins can now take advantage of Sc2gears' most advanced SC2Replay parser engine, and they can also access profile info.
[i]Plugin API 2.0 gives deep insight into replays' structures, advanced info and the actions of the players.[/i] Also provides numerous utilities to parse and process StarCraft II replays.
The javadoc (also available [b][url=http://sc2gearsdb.appspot.com/sc2gears-plugin-api/index.html]online[/url][/b]) contains invaluable information and many example code snipplets.
An overview of the Plugin API 2.0 changes and addition:
 * A new interface to access the Replay parser engine: ReplayFactoryApi
 * A new interface to access profile info: ProfileApi
 * A new interface to interact with the Mouse print recorder: MousePrintRecorderApi
 * A new interface to access icons of different objects: IconsApi
 * Methods to add/remove diagnostic test factories (in the CallbackApi) to be executed by the Diagnostic tool
 * Methods to add/remove menu items to the new "Plugins" menu (in the CallbackApi)
 * Several new methods in many API files (for example InfoApi, LanguageApi and GuiUtilsApi)

plugins classes are only loaded once (so initialize static attributes according to that)
