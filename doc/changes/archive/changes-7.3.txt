[b]Changes and new features in 7.3:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-[b]On-Top Game info dialog (In-game info panel)[/b]
This is an always on top dialog which shows the best leagues and the APM values of the players of your last game without having to ALT+TAB out or having to check them one-by-one.
You can simply drag it with your mouse, Sc2gears will remember its position.
This dialog is only visible if you use the [i]"Fullscreen (Windowed)"[/i] or the [i]"Windowed"[/i] display mode.
This dialog automatically appears after all of your games if you enable [i]"Show On-Top Game info dialog for new replays"[/i] on the Replay autosave tab of the Misc settings dialog.
You can show/hide the game info dialog of the last game from anywhere at any time (from StarCraft II during a game for example) with the [b]CTRL+ALT+I[/b] global hotkey (Global hotkeys must be enabled).
Also there is a [i]"On-Top last game info"[/i] menu item for this in the Tools menu.

-[b]On-Top APM display dialog (In-game current APM)[/b]
