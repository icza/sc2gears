[b]Changes and new features in 8.7:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-[b]A new "icon bar"[/b] in the public comments tab of the Replay analyzer which allows you to insert special symbols (like emotions, arrows etc.) into your comments.

-[b]New setting on the Analyzer tab of the Misc settings dialog: Override detected game format based on match-up[/b]
If you play a non-ladder game, StarCraft II records a game format based on the map size. This is not what you want to see or be included in statistics.
For example if you play a 1v1 game on a 2v2 map, SC II records it as a 2v2 game.
If this new setting is enabled (it is by default), Sc2gears will "guess" the proper game format based on the match-up: if you play a 1v1 game on a 2v2 map, it will show you it as an 1v1 game.

-[b]A new "Custom" game format[/b]
Game format will be set to "Custom" for games with unbalanced team sizes, for example "2v3".

-[b]Improved Replay cache[/b]
The internal replay cache has been redesigned which results in 20% faster replay parsing/searching, lower memory usage and less disk space used by the cache. Also emptying the replay cache became instant.
The new implementation provides the same speed from disk (without having to load it into memory).

-The "Private data" tab in the Replay analyzer now displays the max and remaining allowed comment length.

-EaSynthLookAndFeel has been removed due to having several bugs.
