[b]Changes and new features in 12.3:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-Added Season 9 start date (assumed to be September 12).

-Improved Replay parser engine: replays sent to me in the past causing "Parse error!" are now working properly.

-Word clouds are working again!
Fixed a bug where the Word cloud dialogs did not appear when clicked on any of the "Word cloud" link in the header of many tables.

-Fixed a bug where the Private Video Streaming window would become too wide if the save stream video folder was too long.

-The "Check Mouse print auto-save" diagnostic test no longer states "APM Alert must be enabled" (because it is no longer required).
