[b]Changes and new features in 10.5:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-[b]Main building control chart for Protoss: Chrono Boost usage[/b]
The Main building control chart is now implemented for Protoss, and it visualizes the Chrono Boost usage.
Each Chrono Boosted building has its own row similar to the Zerg injection graph (where each Hatchery has its row visualizing the injections).
The Chrono Boosts are displayed as bars filled with transparent colors, because Chrono Boosts can be "overlapped" (unlike the Spawn Larva). Where 2 or more Chrono Boosts overlap because the player Chrono Boosted a building again before the previous one would have ended, you will see the bar with stronger color indicating the overlap ("waste").

-[b]Complete Polish translation by Marcin "Smuf" StÄ™pniak (for version 10.4).[/b]

-Some drop down lists on the Filters tab of the Replay analyzer now display all possible values.
Previously they were displayed in a scrollable list, but many did not realize it is a scrollable list and believed items were missing (Ladder season filter is a good example).

-Plugin API 2.9:
 *A plugin can now have internal frames as its GUI (similar to the Replay analyzer, Replay search and Multi-replay analysis). These can be created with the CallbackApi.createAndAddInternalFrame() method.

-Other minor changes and improvements.
