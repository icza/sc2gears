[b]Changes and new features in 10.3:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-[b]Ladder season is now better integrated and handled properly.[/b]
Seasons start slightly at different times on different servers, these offsets are now implemented.
On the Filters tab of the Replay search, there is now a new line: "Ladder Season".
There is a new name template symbol to insert the ladder season number: /s (very useful if you want to organize your replays into separate folders based on ladder season).

-Season 7 start date has been added.

-If replay auto-store is enabled and Sc2gears fails to auto-store a replay, a "Failed to store file!" voice is played.

-Sc2gears Database server address has been updated to use the new URL ([url=https://sciigears.appspot.com]https://sciigears.appspot.com[/url]).

-Fixed an error in the Sc2gears Database downloader tool which prevented to download files.
