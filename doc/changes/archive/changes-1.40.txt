[b]Changes since version 1.30:[/b]
--------------------------------------------
-[b]Now works with the latest replay version (1.0, Official Release)[/b], does not support beta phase 1 replays anymore. Note that beta phase 2 replays are somewhat supported, but it wasn't my goal (the replay format is flawed).
-More info is parsed out and displayed on the game info tab: computer difficulty level, player color names. Replay date+time is now displayed on the game info tab too.
-Fixed a bug which caused some opened replays not to appear in the Recent replays menu.
-Changed the unit ID representation in the action list (this way they are much shorter and easier to work with). 
-Updated icons to the new Sc2 icons.
-Changed the default replay and map folder settings according to the SC2 release.
-Code optimizations (alternative coordinate arithmetics to avoid floating point arithmetics).
