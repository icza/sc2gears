Sc2gears 5.6: "Instant" search and analysis!

[b]Changes and new features in 5.6:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

[b]The internal replay cache management has been significantly improved.[/b]
With 2 new additions, replay search and multi-replay analysis [b]take almost ZERO time[/b] even with thousands of replays!
This applies to replays which are already cached - so the first search/analysis will run with approximately the same speed.

-[b]In-memory replay cache management[/b]
There is a setting on the Internal tab of the Misc settings dialog: "Use in-memory replay cache".
If it is enabled (it is by default), Sc2gears will also manage the replay cache in-memory to speed up replay searches, multi-replay analysis and batch-renaming.

-[b]A new name template symbol: /h[/b]
This symbol inserts the MD5 hash of the replay. This might make your file names look a little uglier, but it will EXTREMELY speed up replay searches and multi-replay analysis.
[b]It is recommended to rename all your current replays to add the MD5 hash to the name if you frequently use the search or the multi-rep analysis feature.[/b]
To do that, list all your replays, and rename all with the template "/n  /h./e". This template simply adds the MD5 hash to the end of the current names.
[b]Also add the /h symbol to your replay auto-save name template.[/b]

-A new setting on the Internal tab of the Misc settings dialog: "Use MD5 hash from file name"
You can tell Sc2gears whether to use the MD5 hash info if found in the file names.

-Player aliases now have to be provided as full names: name-gateway-region-bnet_id, for example: "SCIIGears/EU/1/206154".
[b]This is aided by a new player popup menu item: "Copy full name".[/b]
This will allow you to specify your different accounts as aliases across all gateways even if they have the same name.

-Removed the /P and /Q template symbols.

-Code refactoring; other minor changes and improvements.
