Sc2gears 7.0: Plugin interface, Chat stats + more
Sc2gears 7.0: Plugin interface, Chat word statistics, Profile info from Battle.net

[b]Changes and new features in 7.0:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-[b]A new plugin interface![/b]
Java Developers, fire up your IDEs! You can now write plugins and extensions for Sc2gears.
More: [url=https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/features/plugin-interface]Plugin interface[/url]
Forum: [url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sc2gearsdev]Sc2gears developer forum[/url]

-[b]New tool: Plugin manager[/b]
The Plugin manager can be used to see what plugins you have installed, you can see details/properties of the plugins, and you can enable/disable them one by one or all with a click.

-[i]A new "Check plugins" diagnostic task checks if all enabled plugins have been started successfully.[/i]

-[b]New tab in the Multi-replay analysis: Chat words[/b]
This tab shows a table of the chat words used by the player in the replays.
The table shows the occurrence of the words, the number of replays they were used in, % of all replays they were used in, first and last dates they were used.
This Chat statistics is calculated for all players in all replays, and also for each player separately.

-[b]Profile info is now taken from the Battle.net instead of Sc2ranks.com.[/b]
What does this mean?
 * Must faster profile info access
 * Less downtime (Battle.net servers are available most of the time)
 * The retrieved profile info is [b]always up-to-date[/b] (not like in the case of sc2ranks.com where profile data may even be several weeks/months old)
 * You don't have to register or add your account to see profile info (Sc2ranks only provided info about players being in their database)

-[b]New setting: Auto retrieve extended profile info[/b]
If this is checked, extended profile info is automatically retrieved along with the profile info.
Extended profile info contains all leagues (all team info) of a player (not just the best leagues).
The extended profile info is retrieved after base profile info is ready (and displayed), and it happens in the background.

-Sc2gears is now aware of the Season #3 start date.

-Updated the replay parser engine to be able to parse replays where lag hack was used.

-Other minor changes and improvements.





PLUGIN INTERFACE


Plugins are software components that will run along with Sc2gears, but they are developed independently by 3rd party developers and vendors.

Plugins can be a great asset to make your Sc2gears and StarCraft II experience better.

Sc2gears has a plugin interface which allows developers to create plugins and extensions for Sc2gears. 

Since plugins are NOT developed or maintained by me, you should have the same reservations about them as about any applications you download from the Internet.

ONLY DOWNLOAD AND ADD PLUGINS THAT COME FROM TRUSTED SOURCES!

Plugins are distributed as folders. To add a plugin to Sc2gears, you just have to copy the plugin's folder into the "Plugins" folder inside Sc2gears.
You can manage your plugins from the Plugin Manager which is available from the Tools menu inside Sc2gears.

Since plugins are NOT developed by me, I take zero responsibility for what they do or how they do it.
Poorly or viciously written plugins can make your Sc2gears or your whole system slow, unstable, or can even damage it.
Plugins can also access and steal your private data.

AGAIN: ONLY DOWNLOAD AND ADD PLUGINS THAT COME FROM TRUSTED SOURCES!


Plugin development

    [i]The following information is intended for developers.[/i]

You can download the Plugin API (Plugin interface library, example code, Javadoc) from the []Downloads[] page.

If you have any questions, suggestions or you want to share your opinion, visit the []Sc2gears developer forum[].


Plugins are written using the Java language. There are no restrictions, everything can be used from the public Java API.
Plugins can write to the standard output (<code>System.out</code>) or to the standard error (<code>System.err</code>),
they will appear in the application Log (<code>"User content/Logs"</code> folder).

A plugin is a set of files within a folder. It must contain a <i>plugin descriptor</i> file
and java libraries (*.jar files) that contain the code of the plugin - in simple cases it can be one jar file.
All Java libraries (*.jar) in the plugin folder will be loaded and will be available for the plugin.
The Plugin API library must not be included in the plugin jars, because it is contained in Sc2gears!</p>

<p>The plugin descriptor is an XML file which must be in the root of the plugin folder and must be named <code>"Sc2gears-plugin.xml"</code>,
and contains meta-data about the plugin including the plugin name, author, description and main class.</p>

Here is an example of <code>"Sc2gears-plugin.xml"</code>:
[]

<p>The main class must implement the <code>"hu.andras.belicza.sc2gearspluginapi.Plugin"</code> interface or extend a class that implements it.
Moreover the main class must provide a public no-arg constructor (a constructor that takes no arguments).
The main class must also be unique: cannot be added 2 plugins with the same main class!</p>
