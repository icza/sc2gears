[b]Changes and new features in 14.2:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-The name template engine now removes not allowed characters from the generated file name.
This is required because map names may contain characters that are not allowed to be used in file names.
If such characters are encountered, the template engine will substitute them with an underscore (_).

-Added new portrait images.

-Fixed a synchronization issue which sometimes caused incorrect displayed data in the replay search result when the search was performed using multiple CPU cores.

-Other minor changes and improvements.
