Sc2gears 6.0: Global hotkeys, Event based detect.
Sc2gears 6.0: Global hotkeys, Event based new replay detection

[b]Changes and new features in 6.0:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-[b]Global hotkeys[/b]
Global hotkeys can now be enabled from the Settings menu.
With global hotkeys you can do the followings from SC2 (or from any other applications):
   [b]CTRL+ALT+R[/b] enable/disable replay auto-save
   [b]CTRL+ALT+A[/b] enable/disable APM alert
   [b]CTRL+ALT+M[/b] start/stop mouse print recording
   [b]CTRL+ALT+T[/b] bring Sc2gears to front
You can find the global hotkey list on the Keyboard shortcuts dialog (in the Help menu).
The global hotkeys are only available on Windows.

-[b]A new setting on the Replay auto-save tab: "New replay detection method"[/b]
You can choose a method for the Replay auto-saver how to detect new replays.
The [i]"Polling"[/i] is the method that was used before: the auto-replay folders are periodically scanned for new replays.
On Windows there is another method available: [i]"Event based"[/i]. This method does not scan periodically the auto-replay folders, it uses OS services to be notified when a new replay is saved therefore it uses no CPU resource. This is the default now.

-New sounds when replay auto-save and APM alert is turned on/off or when mouse print recording is started/stopped with global hotkeys.

-APM Alert has been re-written using native system calls which results in less CPU usage.

-Map aliases did not work correctly. This is fixed now.
