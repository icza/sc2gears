[b]Changes and new features in 10.6:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-1.4.4 replays are now supported.

-Restructured some tabs in the Multi-replay analysis to avoid confusion/misinterpretation.
The Maps, Build orders, Chats tab which show global statistics for all players/replays are now put under a "Global Stats" tab indicating that these stats are not your or a specific player's stats.

-The manual replay renaming now skips replays whose new name equals to the old one (and therefore will not wrongly append something like [i]" (2)"[/i]).

-The Game info tab of the Replay analyzer now displays the ladder season for AutoMM (ladder) games.
This info has also been added to output of the "print-game-info" action of the [url=https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/features/command-line-interface]Command Line Interface[/url].

-Slightly changed the order of the chart types in the Replay analyzer due to shifted importance...

-Added some new (not-yet-included) icons (for name template symbols and actions).

-The Coreplays.net replay site has been shut down and therefore removed from the replay sharing dialog.

-Other minor changes and improvements.
