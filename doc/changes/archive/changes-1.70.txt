[b]Changes and new features in 1.70:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------
-A new tab in the details of a player in the mulit-rep analysis: [b]Activity trend charts[/b].
On this tab you can see your activity (the games played) at different hours of the day, on different days of the week and in different months of the year. 

-[b]A new name template editor component.[/b] This component is added to the replay rename dialog and to the auto-save name template in the miscellaneous settings.
There is a button for each symbol, clicking on it will insert the symbol to the current position in the template text field.
The editor component hides inappropriate symbols (for example /Fx [i](see below)[/i] is hidden in the replay rename dialog, /c and /Cx [i](see below)[/i] are hidden in the replay auto-save name template editor).

-A new name template symbol: [b]/Cx[/b]. This is a new counter where you can specify the number of digits. Leading zeros will be inserted if necessary.
This (along with the /c symbol) is designed to the replay rename dialog.

-A new name template symbol: [b]/Fx[/b]. Replay counter with fixed x digits, its value is always the number of replays in the target folder +1.
This is designed to the replay auto-save feature.

-A new name template symbol: [b]/Mx[/b]. This symbol can be used to insert the first x words of the map name (instead of the full map name).

-Changed the template mechanism: symbols that require a player index will be silently disregarded if the current replay does not have players in it (for example you refer to the name of the 3rd player in case of a 1v1 replay).

-[b]Improved the winner detection algorithm.[/b] In team games where the winner cannot be told for certain, the largest remaining team will be declared winner (which is most likely to be).
This setting can be changed to leave the winners unknown in these situations in the miscellaneous settings.
Also winner detection has been significantly improved for AI matches (taking into consideration that AI players do not leave).

-A new option in the Multi-replay analysis module: [b]Auto-open first player[/b].
If checked, automatically opens the player with the most games when the analysis is done.

-The results table of a replay search is now default [b]sorted by date[/b] (descending). When the table is rebuilt (replays were renamed, moved deleted etc), the [b]sorting keys are restored[/b].

-A new menu item in Window menu: [b]Start minimized to tray[/b]. If this is enabled, the main window will not appear on startup, only the system tray icon.
The background works will operate of course (replay auto-save for example). You can bring the main window up by double clicking on the system tray icon, or right click on it and "Restore main window".

-A new option in the Miscellaneous settings: [b]Time limit to be included in Multi-rep analysis[/b].
Games shorter and players having less time in a replay than this value will be excluded from the multi-replay analysis.

-Updated the application [b]icon and logo[/b] (thanks to roddds).

-Bug fixes and code optimization.
