[b]Changes and new features in 13.1:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-[b]Improved replay parser engine.[/b]
[b]Expansion level (WoL or HotS) is now parsed[/b], and exposed in the Replay search, on the Game info tab in the Replay analyzer, in the command line interface and in the plugin interface.
[b]Map hash[/b] for HotS replays and custom games (including old ones) [b]is now parsed correctly.[/b]
Added missing ability codes and missing ability and upgrade icons. The map view chart will now for HotS replays too.
Slightly modified the EAPM algorithm to include the Thor's transformations and the Widow Mine's activate actions as ineffective if repeated without time restriction.
The [url=https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/parsing-service]Parsing service[/url] has also been updated with these improvements.
Due to previous incorrect map parsing it is strongly recommended to re-upload all HotS and old custom replays to the [url=https://sites.google.com/site/sc2gears/sc2gears-database]Sc2gears Database[/url].
Easiest way is to just re-upload all your replays (the database detects if a replay is already stored and will only update it, not store it duplicated).
Just list all your replays, right click and choose "Store replays".

-Added new portrait images.

-The Replay analyzer now also displays the XAPM as percent growth (if XAPM is enabled above the chart).

-Code optimization (using Java 7 new features).

-The Map preview tab of the Replay analyzer now automatically tries the replay's gateway for map download if the map is not available on the selected gateway.

-Fixed a bug where the profile engine failed to get profile info of GM ranked players with no games played.

-Plugin API 4.1.
Contains the added new abilities, and also exposes the expansion level (IReplay.getExpansion()).

-Other minor changes, fixes and improvements.
