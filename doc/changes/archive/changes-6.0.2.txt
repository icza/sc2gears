[b]Changes and new features in 6.0.2:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-The auto-updater was not launched properly on some computers. It's fixed now.
The error is caused by folder names that contain spaces. So if you have Sc2gears in such a folder (or inside of such a folder) that has spaces, here's how you can run the update properly:
[b]Copy Sc2gears to a folder without spaces, for example "C:\Sc2gears". Start it, run the updater, after that you can copy it back.[/b]
The new version will not have this error and will run the auto-update properly.
