[b]Changes and new features in 12.4:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-Improved replay parser engine.
Implemented small changes that came with 1.5.3.

-The name template engine now checks and reports if the name template contains characters which are not allowed on the user's operating system.

-The Progress dialog now also displays the average processing speed.

-All tables got a "Select / Deselect all rows" icon in the table header.

-Fixed a bug where the Replay sharing dialog would be placed outside of the screen (making the title bar not visible) on low resolutions like 1024x768.
The Replay sharing dialog is now automatically resized if its size is bigger than the screen size.

-Fixed a bug where retrieving player profiles from Battle.net with no portrait failed.

-Other minor changes and improvements.
