[b]Changes and new features in 5.4:[/b]
--------------------------------------------------------

-A new menu item in the player pop-up menu: [b]"Show profile info in pop-up"[/b]
This will open a dialog window with the profile info of the player.
Basically it shows the profile info that is already available in the tool tip of the players with some extras, but the league info is displayed in a table which can be scrolled if the list is too long, sorted, selected/copied, and the table always shows the full list.
Clicking on the League column header for example will sort the table by Leagues regardless of the game type.
This is also available in the players table of the Multi-replay analysis (Players and Playmates).

-[b]Custom portraits[/b]
By default your battle.net portrait is displayed as the portrait next to your name in the in the Replay analyzer and in the Player Profile dialog.
For a small fee, [b]you can change your portrait picture to anything you like[/b], and everyone who opens a replay in Sc2gears with you in it will see the picture of your choice as your portrait.
All you have to do is provide an image file in a size of 90x90 that you want to be your portrait. You can even set any battle.net portraits that you have not earned in StarCraft II! You can also set your own photo or even animated GIFs!
This can be very useful especially for top players and progamers because their replays are downloaded and checked by thousands or tens of thousands of people.
[i]Example:[/i] open the [url=http://www.mediafire.com/file/fycnus4dcstza7v/custom_portrait.SC2Replay]following replay[/url] in Sc2gears. You will see a custom animated GIF portrait next to the player [b]SCIIGears[/b].

-The Multi-replay analysis now distinguishes between different players having the same name.
If multiple players are found with the same name, subsequent occurrences will be renamed by appending a counter, for example: "someName", "someName (#2)", "someName (#3)" etc.

-New setting in the Analyzer tab of the Misc settings dialog: [b]Max table size in Profile tool tip[/b]
If a player has too many leagues, it will be trimmed and a message will be appended indicating that there are more rows which can be viewed in the Player profile dialog.
The best leagues of all types are always displayed in the tool tip.
You can disable the profile tool tip if you set the max table size to 0.

-The Napkin Look and Feel has been removed to reduced the download size of Sc2gears.

-Other minor changes and improvements.




===============================================================================================================================================

Custom portraits

Sc2gears automatically retrieves and displays the profile info of all players in the Replay analyzer. By default your battle.net portrait image is displayed as the portrait next to your name in the in the Replay analyzer and in the Player Profile dialog.

For a small fee, [b]you can change your portrait picture to anything you like[/b], and everyone who opens a replay with you in it will see the picture of your choice as the player profile.
All you have to do is provide an image file in a size of 90x90 that you want to be your portrait. You can even set any battle.net portraits that you have not earned in StarCraft II! You can also set your own photo or even animated GIFs!
Offending, racist or pornography pictures might be denied (tasty erotic pictures are allowed), so if you want something nasty, it's better to first check if your desired portrait picture is allowed (by sending it to me).

This can be very useful especially for top players and progamers because their replays are downloaded and checked by thousands or tens of thousands of people.
